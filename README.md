Bike Sharing Demand Prediction: Linear Regression Case Study
This project involves building a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes for an online bike-sharing company. By analyzing key features that influence bike rentals, the model aims to provide actionable insights that help the company optimize operations and align business strategies with customer demand.
Objective:
Predict daily demand for shared bikes based on available independent variables.
Help management understand how various factors (like weather, season, working days, etc.) affect bike rentals.
Support strategic planning for entering new markets by modeling demand dynamics.
Key Concepts:
1.Multiple Linear Regression.
2.Feature selection and model interpretation.
3.Business impact through data-driven insights.
